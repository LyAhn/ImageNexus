# ImageNexus formally extractFrames


ImageNexus is a powerful and user-friendly application originally designed to extract frames from GIF files. It allows you to easily convert your favorite animated GIFs into a series of individual image frames. Whether you're a designer, developer, or simply an enthusiast, ImageNexus provides a seamless experience for working with GIF animations. There are plans to continue adding to this project to make it into a whole suite of image tools.
